Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake. The objective of the game is to eat the food that appears on the board without colliding with the walls or the snake's body. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its length increases, and the score increases by 10 points. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its body.
